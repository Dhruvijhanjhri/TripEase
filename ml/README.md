ML scripts for TripEase.

- This folder is for **experimental and training code only** (data loading, feature engineering, model training, evaluation).
- Do **not** import these modules directly into Django views or URLs yet.
- Keep production-ready prediction logic in a separate, clearly defined module later (e.g., `ml_models/`).
