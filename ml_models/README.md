Serialized ML models and production-ready prediction utilities for TripEase.

- Store **versioned model artifacts** here (e.g., `.pkl`, `.joblib`, `.onnx`).
- Include lightweight, well-tested Python modules for **loading models** and **running predictions** used by the Django app.
- Do **not** put training notebooks or heavy experimental code here; keep that under `ml/`.
